                            I'm a full stack web developer from Toronto, Canada.
                            I'm building this app as a way to practice my skills
                            and discover the capabilities of React and other
                            exciting new technologies. I am putting some of my
                            own personal touch on it but generally it is
                            modelled after the official site. Feel free to check

                            The Overwatch League is the first major global
                            esports league with city-based teams and is designed
                            to celebrate the best of the best in the hit
                            Blizzard Entertainment title Overwatch. The
                            Overwatch League aims to follow the model of
                            traditional North American professional sports,
                            using a set of permanent teams and regular season
                            play, rather than the use of promotion and
                            relegation used commonly in other eSports leagues.
                            Each team franchise is backed by an owner, and
                            players that are signed onto the team are assured a
                            minimum annual salary, benefits, and a portion of
                            winnings and revenue-sharing based on how that team
                            performs in the season.
